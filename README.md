## What Does This Tool Do?

Ever wondered whether two lines intersect, run parallel, or are actually the same line? This application does exactly that! 

Given lines in the general form `Ax + By + C = 0`, the analyzer will:
-  Determine if they **intersect**, are **parallel**, or **coincide**
-  Calculate exact **intersection points** (when applicable)
-  Measure the **angle** between intersecting lines
-  Show a beautiful **visual graph** of your lines

Perfect for students, teachers, and anyone working with linear equations!

## Features

### Core Functionality

-  **Angle Calculation**: Measures angles between lines (0¬∞ to 90¬∞)
-  **Special Cases**: Handles vertical lines (B = 0) and horizontal lines (A = 0)

### User Experience
-  **Modern GUI**: Built with CustomTkinter for a sleek, professional look
-  **Live Visualization**: See your lines plotted in real-time with matplotlib
-  **Random Generation**: Quickly fill coefficients with random values for testing

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run from Source (Recommended for Developers)

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NurdauletSovetkhan/Analytic-Geometry-Midterm.git

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Number of Lines
- Minimum: 2 lines
- The program will analyze all possible pairs

### Step 2: Enter Coefficients
For each line, provide three coefficients `A`, `B`, `C` where:
- **A** - coefficient of x
- **B** - coefficient of y
- **C** - constant term

**Important:** At least one of A or B must be non-zero (otherwise it's not a valid line)!

**Tip**: Use the **"Random"** button to auto-fill empty fields for quick testing!

### Step 3: Analyze
Click **"Analyze Lines"** to get:
- Relationship type for each pair (intersect/parallel/coincide)
- Detailed step-by-step mathematical solution
- Intersection points (with coordinates)
- Angles between lines (in degrees)

### Step 4: Visualize (Optional)
Click **"Visualize"** to see:
- All lines plotted on a coordinate system
- Intersection points marked in red
- Automatic scaling and legend

### Additional Actions
- **" Clear"**: Reset all inputs and results
- **" View Source Code"**: Access project information and source files

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Three Intersecting Lines

**Input:**
```
Number of lines: 3

Line 1: A = 1,  B = 1,   C = -2    ‚Üí  x + y - 2 = 0
Line 2: A = 1,  B = -1,  C = 0     ‚Üí  x - y = 0
Line 3: A = 2,  B = -3,  C = 5     ‚Üí  2x - 3y + 5 = 0
```

**Output:**
```
‚úì Pair 1 (Line 1 & Line 2): INTERSECT at (1.00, 1.00), angle = 90.00¬∞
‚úì Pair 2 (Line 1 & Line 3): INTERSECT at (-1.00, 3.00), angle = 33.69¬∞
‚úì Pair 3 (Line 2 & Line 3): INTERSECT at (-5.00, -5.00), angle = 56.31¬∞
```

### Example 2: Parallel Lines

**Input:**
```
Number of lines: 2

Line 1: A = 1,  B = 1,  C = -2    ‚Üí  x + y = 2
Line 2: A = 1,  B = 1,  C = -4    ‚Üí  x + y = 4
```

**Output:**
```
‚ïë Pair 1 (Line 1 & Line 2): PARALLEL (distinct lines, never intersect)
```

### Example 3: Coincident Lines

**Input:**
```
Number of lines: 2

Line 1: A = 2,  B = -3,  C = 5     ‚Üí  2x - 3y + 5 = 0
Line 2: A = 4,  B = -6,  C = 10    ‚Üí  4x - 6y + 10 = 0
```

**Output:**
```
‚â° Pair 1 (Line 1 & Line 2): COINCIDENT (same line)
```

## Mathematical Algorithms

### Relationship Detection
Uses proportionality of coefficients:
- **Coincident**: `A‚ÇÅ/A‚ÇÇ = B‚ÇÅ/B‚ÇÇ = C‚ÇÅ/C‚ÇÇ`
- **Parallel**: `A‚ÇÅ/A‚ÇÇ = B‚ÇÅ/B‚ÇÇ ‚â† C‚ÇÅ/C‚ÇÇ`
- **Intersect**: `A‚ÇÅ/A‚ÇÇ ‚â† B‚ÇÅ/B‚ÇÇ`

### Intersection Points
Uses **Cramer's Rule** to solve the system:
```
A‚ÇÅx + B‚ÇÅy = -C‚ÇÅ
A‚ÇÇx + B‚ÇÇy = -C‚ÇÇ

x = D‚Çì/D,  y = D·µß/D

where:
D  = A‚ÇÅB‚ÇÇ - A‚ÇÇB‚ÇÅ
D‚Çì = (-C‚ÇÅ)B‚ÇÇ - (-C‚ÇÇ)B‚ÇÅ
D·µß = A‚ÇÅ(-C‚ÇÇ) - A‚ÇÇ(-C‚ÇÅ)
```

### 3. Angle Calculation
For non-vertical lines with slopes m‚ÇÅ and m‚ÇÇ:
```
tan(Œ∏) = |m‚ÇÇ - m‚ÇÅ| / |1 + m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ|

where:
m = -A/B (slope)
Œ∏ ‚àà [0¬∞, 90¬∞]
```

Special case: If `m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ = -1`, lines are perpendicular (Œ∏ = 90¬∞)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Application won't start
- **Solution**: Make sure Python 3.12+ is installed
- **Check**: `python --version`

**Issue**: "Module not found" errors
- **Solution**: Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: .exe file won't run
